"I am neither seen nor heard, yet I am everywhere. Those who seek to understand me never truly do. Knowledge is my weapon, secrecy my ally. I do not reveal myself to the unworthy, and my influence is felt in silence. Some say I control the game, others claim I am the game. But I am neither; I am the one who watches it all."
